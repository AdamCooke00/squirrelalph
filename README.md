## Description

Squirrel is a community coin on the Alephium Blockchain. The goal of SQRL is to be a staple of the Alephium community promoting adoption via outreach, educational resource creation, and a multitude of other things.

> your passive-aggresive backyard squirrel

SQRL is supposed to represent that classic east coast squirrel. That squirrel that works hard all year long to ensure it will survive the severe winter. That squirrel commited to adapting and learning through trial-and-error. SQRL is a project that promotes and encourages new developers to try Ralph & experiment with UTxO, Sharding, and all the other great things that make Alephium futureproof.

## Ideal Scenario

Squirrel becomes loved and adopted by the community and we use it together to do great things for Alephium, Crypto Industry, and the world as a whole.

## Contract Explained

SQRL Faucet is a simple faucet that allows anybody to claim up to 1 Million SQRL per call.
It is my first full application on Alephium.
Theoretically, anybody could drain the faucet with consequetive calls if they chose to.
